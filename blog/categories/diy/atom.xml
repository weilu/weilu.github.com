    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the legendary Jeff Atwood puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p>We computer geeks like it dark. Really dark. Ideally, we'd be in a cave. A cave … with an internet connection.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/post/2013-08-27/social.jpg" title="Social interaction" alt="Social interaction" /></p>

<p>See, being in the dark room isn't all about avoiding social interaction. It actually helps me focus. But the brightness of the screen strains my eyes even with the lowest brightness setting on my MacBook. It's not just working, even watching a movie -- I could hear my eyes screaming when the scene switches from night time to bright daytime.</p>

<p>So, allow me to quote Jeff Atwood again, together with what he quoted in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/11/bias-lighting.html">his post about bias lighting</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You don't want total darkness, what you want is some indirect lighting – specifically bias lighting. It helps your eyes compensate and adapt to bright displays.</p>

<blockquote><p>"[Bias lighting] works because it provides enough ambient light in the viewing area that your pupils don't have to dilate as far. This makes for less eyestrain when a flashbang gets thrown your way or a bolt of lightning streams across the screen," he told Ars. "Because the display is no longer the only object emitting light in the room, colors and black levels appear richer than they would in a totally black environment. Bias lighting is key in maintaining a reference quality picture and reducing eye-strain."</p></blockquote>

<p>Bias lighting is the happy intersection of indirect lighting and light compensation. It reduces eye strain and produces a better, more comfortable overall computing display experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>I looked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0053B347M">Antec Halo 6 LED Bias Lighting Kit</a> he recommended. Functionally it looks usable but my biggest problem is that it'd sticks to the back my screen -- it's like getting my MacBook a permanent tattoo... that glows in the dark. So, no thank you. But it's a great idea and dead simple by design -- it's just a strip of USB powered LEDs. Why don't I make one myself? I can make it better by attaching elastic bands on both ends of the strip instead of the sticky. With that, it can be striped onto any laptop diagonally.</p>

<p>So off I went to <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/BqLG3">Sim Lim Tower</a> on a Sunday morning. Sadly there was only one shop open that sells LEDs at all. And to make it worse, the LED strips they sell require 12V, while USBs only supply 5V. I thought of getting a converter but it just seems unnecessary when there are 12V strips available online. I figured I'd just order online and wait a couple days. Hopefully by then I haven't lost interests in building it. As I was walking out the shop, something caught my eyes:</p>

<p><img class='pair' src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/led-lamp-front.jpg" title="LED lamp" alt="LED lamp">
<img class='pair' src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/led-lamp-back.jpg" title="LED lamp" alt="LED lamp"></p>

<p>It fits my needs perfectly despite its awkward appearance. Still workable. I just need to take it apart and give it a better UI. So with SGD$10 I took it home. Here is what it looks like in action out of the box:</p>

<img class='pair' src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/led-lamp-in-action-front.jpg" title="LED lamp in action" alt="LED lamp in action"></p>

<p>It's definitely bright enough but doesn't quite stand well as you can see. So here we go:</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Get rid off what does not work well.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/remove-things.jpg" title="Remove things" alt="Remove things"></p>

<ul>
<li>Step 2: Move fast and break things.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/move-fast.jpg" title="Move fast" alt="Move fast"></p>

<ul>
<li>Step 3: Put it back together, with some soldering, and pretty designer tapes.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/put-back.jpg" title="Put back" alt="Put back"></p>

<ul>
<li>Step 4: Change of plan. I bought flat elastic band to attach to the light. But at this point the light has become too pretty to be attached to the black elastic band. I mean, look at it:</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="pair" src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/leaf-front.jpg" title="Leaf front" alt="Leaf front">
<img class="pair" src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/leaf-back.jpg" title="Leaf back" alt="Leaf back"></p>

<p>So I ended up attaching a hook to the back. It hooks up nicely to my Air and is easily detachable:</p>

<img src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/hook-up-front.jpg" title="Hook up front" alt="Hook up front"></p>

<ul>
<li>Step 5: Put it in use and show off on your blog ;) Here's before and after:</li>
</ul>

<img class="pair" src="http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2013-08-27/after.jpg" title="After" alt="After"></p>

<p>I didn't make the bias lighting from scratch. I simply gave the USB powered LEDs a new UI that suites my needs and tastes better. All in all, it was a fun mini project =)</p>

    <id>http://weilu.github.io/blog/2012/07/02/hurricane-katrina</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about the song Hurricane Katrina by Nadeah. The bottom line is that I love the song, but I didn't buy the song and I'm not proud of it.</p>

<p>First I heard the song on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/roots/playlist/default.htm">Triple J</a> How did I learn about such an awesome Australian radio station? That's another story goes back to <a href="http://railscamps.com/">Rails Camp</a>@<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NoYP">Springbrook</a> and a nice gentlemen who goes by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRatjens">@MarkRatjens</a> on Twitter =)</p>

<p>The song instantly got to me. My first reaction was to go on youtube trying to search for it. There was a couple live versions. I was of course dissatisfied. So next up vimeo.com yet no studio version. But the silver lining is that I found another cute and apparently more famous song of Nadeah's : Odile</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31532711" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>So after playing Odile for a couple times I decided the album "Venus Gets Even" which both songs are from is what I want.</p>

<p>ME WANTZ:
<img src="/images/post/2012-07-02-venus-gets-even.jpg" title="[venus gets even]" ></p>

<p>So being a responsible good citizen as I am, I went to iTunes Store. Searched and got: <em>Your search had no results.</em> Hmmm fine. Googled and got to Nadeah's official site. Sweet, I can 'buy online' or 'by on iTunes'. Let's try iTunes again, since it would not require shipping of any sort. There I was, iTunes Store France... Never mind, I still know where the buy button is. So I clicked and got: <em>This Apple ID is only valid for purchases in the U.S. iTunes Store. You will be switched to that Store. Try your purchase again.</em> And redirected to iTunes Store home page I was. Back to square one. Fine I'll have it shipped. So I filled in my shipping details, was redirected to paypal, logged in and bam! something like <em>The merchant does not ship to your country.</em> And redirected I was back on Nadeah's homepage. Why does nobody want to take my money?!</p>

<p><img src='http://weilu.github.io/images/post/2012-07-02-rage-face.png' title='rageface' class='plain'/></p>

<p>That's it, torrent time. There we go: 0 seed and 0 leech. You know how it works - the more you can't have it, the more you desire it. So the only decent version I have is from streaming from Triple J. If only I could record it...</p>

<p>Googling mac audio recorder gives me <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. Following the <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_mac.html">tutorial</a> I had my audio output redirect to <a href="http://cycling74.com/soundflower-landing-page/">soundflower</a> and simply by playing the time range of the streaming on Triple J the song was recorded. With a bit of cleaning up like some cropping and fading out the last bit. Here is what I got:</p>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source src="http://weilu.github.io/media/Hurricane_Katrina.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  Awww too bad your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio></p>

<p>Enjoy. I guess that's what they call a guilty pleasure.</p>

<p>*disclaimer: I do not own the song. The song is not for distribution. It's only for sharing because it is beautiful.</p>
